entire code must be a series of functions which are one expression. no new lines or spaces will be counted, and no variables can be declared
all data must be passed as parameters and is destroyed when a function terminates
functions are separated by //
FUNCTIONAME(PARAMETER1,PARAMETER2,...)=EXPRESSION
BEGIN(args) runs at the start with command line parameters passed in an ordered set
TERMINATE() is called to clear cache and end all processes
DISPLAY(PIXEL TUPLE, WINDOW PARAMS) displays pixels to screen
WINDOW PARAMS must contain `width` and `height`

file extension: .sw

1 evaluates to true in a if condition

set(get(params,`a`),`b`,1) on params={`a`:{`b`:0}} -> params={`a`:{`b`:1}}

:= used for conditional paramters, such that f(a,b:=c) can be invoked as f(a) or f(a,b) where b defaults to c

{}=0
not({})=1
{}'=1

get([1,10,11,100],0) = 1
get(01,1) = 0

character literal -> ~
causes output to treat byte as a character
